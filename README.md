# A Real Time Chatroom Using boost::asio
- This project is a simple chat room application implemented using the `boost::asio` library in C++. The chat room allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time. The server acts as a central hub, relaying messages between clients.

- You can also whisper to specific clients by mentioning their username in the message. The server will ensure that the message is delivered only to the intended recipient.
